**Figure 5. Environmental drivers of D50 timing analyzed using partial correlation controlling for U90 influence.** Partial correlation coefficients between monthly environmental conditions and D50 (50% senescence timing) after controlling for U90, shown for HLS (gray bars, 2016-2023, n=8) and MCD (black bars, 2001-2023, n=23) datasets. Environmental factors and months are organized as in Figure 4. Positive partial correlations indicate that higher environmental values delay D50 timing independent of U90 effects. Asterisks denote statistical significance (* p < 0.05). Unlike U90, D50 showed inconsistent and weak relationships with environmental factors across both temporal scales. Complete partial correlation coefficients and p-values are provided in Supplementary Table S5.
