Figure 5. Environmental drivers of D50 (senescence timing). Partial correlation coefficients (controlling for U90 influence) between monthly environmental variables and D50 timing for HLS (2016-2023, n=8, gray bars) and MODIS MCD12Q2 (2001-2023, n=23, black bars) datasets. Variables include precipitation (P), salinity (S), air temperature (T), accumulated temperature (Acc.T), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for May-August. Unlike U90, no consistent dominant driver was identified. * p<0.05.
