Figure 3. Annual time-series of rice yield and U90-D50 duration for (a) GQ, (b) DJ, and (c) SK. Bars represent annual yield (left y-axis, t/ha). Red line (μ) shows a spatial mean of U90-D50 duration for pixels where each cultivar was grown (right y-axis, days), with numbers indicating cultivated pixel counts. Shaded area (±1.5σ) and dashed lines (max/min) illustrate within-field spatial variability. Complete statistics in Supplementary Table S4.
