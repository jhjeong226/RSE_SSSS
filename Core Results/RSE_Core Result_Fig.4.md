**Figure 4. Environmental drivers of U90 timing across five factors and four months.** Correlation coefficients (r) between monthly environmental conditions and U90 (90% green-up timing) for HLS (gray bars, 2016-2023, n=8) and MCD (black bars, 2001-2023, n=23) datasets. Environmental factors include precipitation (P), salinity (S), temperature (T), accumulated temperature (Acc.T), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for May through August. Positive correlations indicate that higher environmental values delay U90 timing. Asterisks denote statistical significance (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). Salinity during May through July showed the strongest and most consistent positive correlations with U90 in both datasets. Complete correlation coefficients and p-values are provided in Supplementary Table S5.
