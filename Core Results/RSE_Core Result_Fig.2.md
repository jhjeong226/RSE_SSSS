Figure 2. Relationship between U90-D50 duration and rice yield for (a) all cultivars (n=68), (b) GQ (n=7), (c) DJ (n=7), and (d) SK (n=7). Each point represents one field-year observation with regression line. Correlation coefficients (r) and significance levels (* p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001) are shown in each panel.
