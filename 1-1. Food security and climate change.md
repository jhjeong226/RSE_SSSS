# Food security and climate change
## Paragraph outline
- ##### 독자의 반응 목표
	- 쌀은 정말 중요한 식량 작물이구나.
	- 기후변화가 쌀 생산량을 위협하는구나.
	- 이건 전 지구적 식량 안보와 직결되는 중요하고 시급한 문제구나.
- ##### 전략
	- 가장 큰 그림인 'Global food security'와, 'Rice'의 중요성을 언급하며 관심 유도
	- 벼의 재배 특성으로부터 재배 지역이 저지대 임을 유도
	- 기후변화로 저지대가 받을 수 있는 영향을 언급하며 위협 구체화

## Manuscript

Global food security is facing a critical challenge as climate change threatens the production of rice, the staple food for more than half of the world's population (Fahad et al. 2019; Mthiyane et al. 2024; Koc et al. 2024). Rice has the unique characteristic of being highly sensitive to water deficits while also being adapted to flooded conditions through the development of aerenchyma (Bouman et al. 2007). This trait explains why its cultivation is concentrated in lowland areas where a stable water supply can be maintained. Irrigated and rainfed lowlands account for approximately 75% and 19% of global rice production, respectively (Datta et al. 2017; Hairmansis et al. 2017). However, these vital agricultural zones are increasingly vulnerable. Climate change not only complicates the stable supply of water resources through altered precipitation patterns (Nam et al. 2016) but also induces direct threats such as the loss of arable land and salt stress from sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion (Mimura 1999; Dasgupta et al. 2018; Marfai 2014; Elsey-Quirk et al. 2024; Lovelock et al. 2017; Silliman et al. 2005).

기후 변화로 인해 전 세계 인구의 절반 이상이 주식인 쌀의 생산이 위협받으면서 전 세계 식량 안보는 중요한 도전에 직면해 있습니다(Fahad et al. 2019; Mthyane et al. 2024; Koc et al. 2024). 쌀은 물 부족에 매우 민감하면서도 대기질 개발을 통해 홍수 조건에 적응하는 독특한 특성을 가지고 있습니다(Bouman et al. 2007). 이러한 특성은 안정적인 물 공급이 유지될 수 있는 저지대 지역에 쌀 재배가 집중되는 이유를 설명합니다. 관개 저지대와 빗물 공급 저지대는 각각 전 세계 쌀 생산량의 약 75%와 19%를 차지합니다(Data et al. 2017; Hairmansis et al. 2017). 그러나 이러한 중요한 농업 지역은 점점 더 취약해지고 있습니다. 기후 변화는 변화된 강수량 패턴을 통해 안정적인 수자원 공급을 복잡하게 할 뿐만 아니라(Nam et al. 2016) 해수면 상승으로 인한 경작지 손실과 염분 스트레스와 같은 직접적인 위협을 유발합니다(Mimura 1999; Dasgupta et al. 2018; Marfai 2014; Elsey-Quirk et al. 2024; Lovelock et al. 2017; Silliman et al. 2005).

## v2 (Citation)

Global food security is facing a critical challenge as climate change threatens the production of rice, the staple food for more than half of the world's population (Matthews et al. 1995; Khush 2005; Naylor et al. 2007; Seck et al. 2012). Rice has the unique characteristic of being highly sensitive to water deficits (Tuong and Bouman 2003; Davatgar et al. 2009) while also being adapted to flooded conditions through the development of aerenchyma (Steffens et al. 2011; Voesenek and Bailey-Serres 2015). This trait explains why its cultivation is concentrated in lowland areas where a stable water supply can be maintained (Bouman and Tuong 2001). Irrigated and rainfed lowlands account for approximately 75% and 19% of global rice production, respectively (Bouman et al. 2007). However, these vital agricultural zones are increasingly vulnerable. Climate change not only complicates the stable supply of water resources through altered precipitation patterns (Konapala et al. 2020; Schewe et al. 2014) but also induces direct threats such as the loss of arable land (Zhang and Cai 2011) and salt stress from sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion (Mimura 1999; Elsey-Quirk et al. 2024; Silliman et al. 2005; Lovelock et al. 2017).

## 1st Draft

Global food security is facing a critical challenge as climate change threatens the production of rice, the staple food for more than half of the world's population (Khush, 2005; Naylor et al., 2007; Seck et al., 2012). Rice has the unique characteristic of being highly sensitive to water deficits (Davatgar et al., 2009; Tuong and Bouman, 2003) while also being adapted to flooded conditions through the development of aerenchyma (Steffens et al., 2011; Voesenek and Bailey-Serres, 2015). This trait explains why its cultivation is concentrated in lowland areas where a stable water supply can be maintained (Bouman and Tuong, 2001). Irrigated and rainfed lowlands account for approximately 75% and 19% of global rice production, respectively (Bouman et al., 2007). However, these vital agricultural zones are increasingly vulnerable. Climate change not only complicates the stable supply of water resources through altered precipitation patterns (Konapala et al., 2020; Schewe et al., 2014) but also induces direct threats such as the loss of arable land (Zhang and Cai, 2011) and salt stress from sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion (Mimura, 1999; Dasgupta et al., 2018; Elsey-Quirk et al., 2024).


Global food security is facing a critical challenge as climate change threatens the production of rice, the staple food for more than half of the world's population (Khush, 2005; Naylor et al., 2007; Seck et al., 2012). Rice has the unique characteristic of being highly sensitive to water deficits (Davatgar et al., 2009; Tuong and Bouman, 2003) while also being adapted to flooded conditions through the development of aerenchyma (Steffens et al., 2011; Voesenek and Bailey-Serres, 2015). This trait explains why its cultivation is concentrated in lowland areas where a stable water supply can be maintained (Bouman and Tuong, 2001). In fact, irrigated and rainfed lowlands account for approximately 75% and 19% of global rice production, respectively (Bouman et al., 2007), indicating that the water supply system is the dominant determinant of where rice is grown. However, these vital agricultural zones are increasingly vulnerable. Climate change not only complicates the stable supply of water resources through changing precipitation patterns (Konapala et al., 2020; Schewe et al., 2014) but also induces direct threats such as the loss of arable land (Zhang and Cai, 2011) and salt stress from sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion (Mimura, 1999; Dasgupta et al., 2018; Elsey-Quirk et al., 2024).
