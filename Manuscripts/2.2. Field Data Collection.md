Field-level cultivation data and yield measurements were collected from rice paddies managed by Saedlman Agricultural Corporation, which operates approximately 610 hectares within the Seosan A district under a collectively managed production system (Figure 1). The study period spans 2016 to 2023, excluding 2017 when severe salinity damage necessitated delayed re-transplanting, rendering that year's records incomplete. This provides seven growing seasons with reliable field data. Rice yield data were collected through standardized field sampling conducted at harvest. For each field, five random sampling points were selected, and all rice plants within a 50×50 cm quadrat were harvested at each point. Grain weight was measured after threshing, and yields were converted to tonnes per hectare (t/ha) based on plant density observed in the quadrat. This sampling approach is efficient for operational-scale monitoring but has inherent limitations in representing within-field variability (Lobell et al., 2015). The dataset includes 68 field-year combinations representing 45 different rice cultivars with diverse maturity classes and agronomic traits. Field allocations for these cultivars varied annually, preventing direct spatial tracking of individual cultivars across years. Three cultivars showed consistent cultivation throughout the period: Golden Queen (GQ, code 120, semi-glutinous medium-late japonica), Dongjinchal (DJ, code 180, glutinous rice for processing), and Samkwang (SK, code 240, non-glutinous medium-late japonica). These cultivars share a medium-late maturity class and provide seven years of observations each (n=7 per cultivar), enabling cultivar-specific analysis. Cultivation records including field locations, cultivar codes, transplanting dates, and harvest dates were obtained from Saedlman Agricultural Corporation.
