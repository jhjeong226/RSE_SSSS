### 3.3 Identification of Optimal Yield Proxy
We evaluated three categories of satellite-based metrics to determine the most effective proxy for rice yield: vegetation indices, phenological timings, and phenological durations.

#### 3.3.1 Vegetation Indices
We calculated four vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, GCVI, NDWI) from both MODIS MOD09GA and Landsat 8 imagery. For each index, we extracted the annual maximum value using Maximum Value Composite to minimize cloud contamination and capture peak canopy conditions.

#### 3.3.2 Phenological Timings
Seven phenological timing metrics were extracted from HLS MSLSP products, representing key growth stages: U15, U50, U90 (green-up stages), Peak (maximum greenness), and D90, D50, D15 (senescence stages). Each metric indicates the date (DOY) when vegetation reaches the corresponding developmental stage.

#### 3.3.3 Phenological Durations
We calculated 21 duration metrics by computing temporal intervals between all pairs of the seven timing stages. These durations quantify the length of specific growth periods, such as U90-D50 representing days between 90% green-up and 50% senescence.

#### 3.3.4 Statistical Analysis
Pearson correlation coefficients between each metric and rice yield were calculated at three analysis levels: all cultivar-year combinations (n=68), three repeatedly cultivated cultivars combined (n=21), and individual cultivars (n=7 each). For duration metrics, Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons (adjusted α = 0.05/21 = 0.0024). The metric showing the strongest and most consistent correlation across levels was selected as the optimal yield proxy.
