# Identifying Critical Environmental Windows for Rice Yield through Satellite Phenology

## Abstract

## 1. Introduction

Global food security is facing a critical challenge as climate change threatens the production of rice, the staple food for more than half of the world's population (Khush, 2005; Naylor et al., 2007; Seck et al., 2012). Rice has the unique characteristic of being highly sensitive to water deficits (Davatgar et al., 2009; Tuong and Bouman, 2003) while also being adapted to flooded conditions through the development of aerenchyma (Steffens et al., 2011; Voesenek and Bailey-Serres, 2015). This trait explains why its cultivation is concentrated in lowland areas where a stable water supply can be maintained (Bouman and Tuong, 2001). In fact, irrigated and rainfed lowlands account for approximately 75% and 19% of global rice production, respectively (Bouman et al., 2007), indicating that the water supply system is the dominant determinant of where rice is grown. However, these vital agricultural zones are increasingly vulnerable. Climate change not only complicates the stable supply of water resources through changing precipitation patterns (Konapala et al., 2020; Schewe et al., 2014) but also induces direct threats such as the loss of arable land (Zhang and Cai, 2011) and salt stress from sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion (Mimura, 1999; Dasgupta et al., 2018; Elsey-Quirk et al., 2024).
Maintaining rice productivity in these vulnerable lowlands presents a fundamental challenge due to increasing threats from climate change. This challenge is particularly acute in coastal and reclaimed lands, where the balance between freshwater and saline environments is most delicate. Despite its susceptibility to salinity, rice was widely adopted for these areas because the practice of flooded cultivation can mitigate salt stress (Asch and Wopereis, 2001; Ma et al., 2020; Negrão et al., 2011). However, this delicate management balance is under increasing pressure. Recent studies have reported that climate change is degrading coastal ecosystems and threatening livelihoods through droughts, sea-level fluctuations, and saltwater intrusion (Dasgupta et al., 2018; Eslami et al., 2021; Wernberg et al., 2024). Therefore, maintaining rice productivity under these escalating threats requires advanced monitoring systems that can detect and diagnose environmental stressors at operational scales.
Satellite remote sensing has emerged as a key technology to overcome the spatial and temporal limitations of direct field observation in monitoring crop conditions (Omia et al., 2023; Segarra et al., 2020; Sishodia et al., 2020). While field observation provides crucial and irreplaceable information, it cannot practically cover large agricultural landscapes at the frequencies required for crop management (Gao et al., 2017; Lehecka, 2014; Lobell, 2013). Optical satellite imagery complements ground observations by addressing the spatial scalability challenge, but it has fundamental constraints inherent to snapshot-based observation. Data availability is limited by long revisit times and cloud cover (Asner, 2001; Huang et al., 2018), while vegetation indices suffer from signal saturation in dense canopies (Huete, 2012; Thenkabail et al., 2000; Zeng et al., 2022). These limitations prevent a deeper understanding of the environmental causes of crop stress and hinder the reliable estimation of yields (Wu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2020).
To overcome the limitations of snapshot-based information, Land Surface Phenology (LSP), which tracks seasonal vegetation dynamics through time-series analysis, has become a central paradigm in agricultural remote sensing (Gao et al., 2017; Reed et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 2003). This approach has proven valuable for yield estimation across major crops, including maize, soybean, and rice (Bolton and Friedl, 2013; Fang et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2021; Ji et al., 2021). Early applications suffered from coarse spatial resolution that missed field-scale heterogeneity and from discrepancies between satellite and ground-based observations, particularly for late-season phenology (Klosterman et al., 2014; Ozdogan, 2010). While recent advances in multi-sensor fusion have addressed some resolution issues, challenges persist in integrating high-resolution datasets at operational scales and in accounting for within-species variability, such as cultivar differences, that can significantly alter phenology-yield relationships (Bolton et al., 2020; Dronova and Taddeo, 2022; Gao et al., 2025). 
Plant phenology critically influences crop yield by determining the timing and duration of resource acquisition (Nord and Lynch, 2009; Pei et al., 2025). Several studies have focused on certain growth stages (e.g., reproductive phase or grain-filling duration) that are particularly critical for final yield (Farooq et al., 2014; Nazir et al., 2021). Yang et al. (2008) showed that grain-filling duration, rather than grain-filling rate, governs yield variation, as longer duration allows greater accumulation of solar radiation and heat units. From a remote sensing perspective, Kong et al. (2026) demonstrated that accumulated Gross Primary Productivity during the heading-to-harvest period, estimated via NIRvP (near-infrared vegetation reflectance × incoming sunlight), explained 76% of the variance in rice yield. These findings demonstrate that duration-based phenological metrics effectively capture yield-determining processes. However, few attempts have been made to diagnose how environmental factors govern phenology-yield relationships throughout the season, rather than establishing fragmentary correlations between metrics and final yield. This limits practical application, as simple correlations cannot reveal which specific stressor (e.g., water deficit or salinity) causes yield decline. A critical gap, therefore, remains in understanding how environmental drivers affect crop development and yield by influencing phenological processes.
To address this critical gap and transition from prediction to a diagnostic analysis, this study develops an integrated framework that first identifies robust phenology-based indicators and then utilizes them to diagnose the environmental drivers of yield variability at both temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, this research aims to answer the following questions:
1. Which phenological metrics provide the most interpretable and robust relationship with rice yield in a saline-affected coastal environment, and what factors govern their performance?
2. How do the durations of key phenological stages respond to monthly variations in environmental conditions? Through a systematic temporal analysis, which environmental factor during which specific month exerts the dominant control over these stage durations?
3. Can spatial clustering based on these phenological indicators successfully compartmentalize regions of chronic vulnerability, and can the distinct patterns of these clusters be explained by the critical environmental factors and timings identified in the preceding temporal analysis?
By linking the temporal diagnosis of environmental drivers with the spatial analysis of vulnerability patterns, this study will provide actionable, location- and timing-specific insights for enhancing the resilience of coastal rice systems under a changing climate.

## 2. Study Area and Datasets
### 2.1. Study Site Characteristics
The study was conducted in the Seosan A district (36.60° to 36.79° N, 126.37° to 126.52° E), a 6,383-hectare reclaimed agricultural area on the west coast of the Republic of Korea (Fig. 1). The land was reclaimed from tidal flats in 1984 and converted to agricultural use in 1995. As a former coastal wetland, soil salinity remains a persistent environmental constraint despite three decades of cultivation, with ongoing disputes over salinity-related yield losses. The site exhibits a temperate marine climate with an annual average temperature of 12.1°C (August maximum 25.3°C, January minimum -1.6°C). Annual precipitation averages 1,253.7 mm, with 56% concentrated in summer months (June to August). This seasonal pattern supports a rice monoculture system with transplanting in late May and harvest from early to mid-October. Agricultural irrigation water is supplied from Ganwol Lake, a freshwater reservoir created by the Seosan A seawall. Five major pumping stations draw water from Ganwol Lake and distribute it to spatially separated zones within the Seosan A district (Fig. 1).

### 2.2. Field Data Collection
The field data for this study were collected from 'Saedlman,' an agricultural cooperative corporation that cultivates 610 hectares of rice paddies within the Seosan A district. Saedlman operates an integrated production system, collectively managing the entire rice harvesting process. Furthermore, the cooperative’s cultivation system had significant variability patterns over the last seven years. In 2017, record-breaking salinity damage occurred. Due to this damage, farmers re-transplanted rice in July which was a one-month delay. Because of this impact, rice production records from that year are incomplete and thus unusable for this research. Therefore, this study uses reliable data from 2016 to 2023, excluding 2017. During this period, a total of 45 different cultivars were harvested. Regarding their characteristics, while maturity was predominantly medium and late, other traits like morphology, resistance, palatability, and productivity were highly diverse. More importantly, the field allocation for these cultivars varied from year to year. This irregularity makes it nearly impossible to directly match field locations and cultivars across the years. Under this high turnover, three cultivars (Golden Queen, Dongjinchal, Samkwang) were most frequently cultivated. These three share a medium-late maturity trait. Golden Queen is semi-glutinous high-quality rice. Dongjinchal is glutinous rice for food product processing. Samkwang is non-glutinous high quality rice. As each of the 45 cultivars has its own phenological and physiological traits, this results in different growth patterns and yield potentials, creating variability in the data. To minimize variability from diverse cultivar characteristics, this selected these three most frequently harvested cultivars for a cultivar-focused analysis.
Significant characteristic of the study area is its unique irrigation system. The 610 ha of vast fields managed by Saedlman share identical climatic conditions and a common geological background as reclaimed land. However, irrigation water is supplied via five differently located major pumping stations although all stations draw from a common freshwater lake, Ganwol Lake.
This unique setting provides a valuable natural experiment for salinity and this research. It allows for precise isolation and analysis of the effects of varying water quality, particularly salinity from different pumping stations on rice growth stages and final yield.

### 2.3. Environmental Monitoring Data
Salinity and meteorological data were obtained from governmental organizations of the Republic of Korea. Salinity data of the river which is irrigation source of the target fields were acquired from two sources: The Korea Rural Community Corporation and the Ministry of Environment. The Korea Rural Community Corporation provides daily salinity measurements at one monitoring point, with records available since 2017. The Ministry of Environment provides monthly measurements at three points corresponding to the upper, mid, and lower sections of the river. These records cover a longer period, from 1997 to the present. Meteorological data (monthly precipitation, daily air temperature, and daily vapor pressure deficit) were collected from Automated Synoptic Observing System (ASOS) of the Korea Meteorological Administration. We used data from the Seosan station (Station ID: 129), which is the closest station to the study area, located 15 km from the irrigation source river center point.

### 2.4. Satellite Remote Sensing Data
We utilized satellite data from multiple sources as surface reflectance inputs and land surface phenology products.
We obtained MODIS/Terra Surface Reflectance Daily L2G Global(MOD09GA) Version 6.1, Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) Tier 1 Raw Scenes, and Landsat 8 Collection 2 Tier 1 Calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. These products were applied to calculate vegetation indices in this research. MOD09GA, provides daily surface reflectance of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with a spatial resolution of 500m for seven spectral bands covering since 2000(Roger et al., 2020), with atmospheric conditions correction. Band 1 to 4 were used. Landsat 5 and 8 products were collected by Landsat 5 TM sensor (LT05) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor (LC08) respectively. LT05 and LC08 sensors also provide surface reflectance but with a higher spatial resolution, a 30m at a 16 day temporal frequency(LS citiation?). We used Band 1 to 4 from LT05, and Band 2 to 5 from LC08.
In terms of the land surface phenology(LSP) products, two datasets were utilized: the standard MODIS/Terra+Aqua Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product and high-resolution product derived from Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data. MCD12Q2 uses the 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) with the spatial resolution in 500m to 1km with annual temporal resolution since 2001. It identifies phenology metrics such as onset of greenness, greenup midpoint, maturity, peak greenness, senescence, greendown midpoint, dormancy, EVI2 minimum, EVI2 amplitude, integrated EVI2 along the vegetation cycle(Gray et al., 2022). To achieve a higher spatial detail, we generated a high-resolution (30 m) LSP dataset for our study site. HLS provides 30 m resolution surface reflectance with temporal resolution of every 2 to 3 days, covering from 2016, providing same spatial and temporal resolution of LSP dataset. We applied the phenology detection algorithm detailed by Bolton et al. (2020), originally developed for North America, it was applied in our study area. This algorithm identifies the following phenology timing metrics are: U15, U50, and U90 (the dates at which 15%, 50%, and 90% of the greenness increase is reached, respectively), Peak (the date of maximum greenness), and D90, D50, and D15 (the dates at which greenness has fallen to 90%, 50%, and 15% of the peak, respectively).

## 3. Method
### 3.1. Identification of Optimal Yield Proxy
To identify the optimal satellite-based yield proxy, we compared three categories of metrics, peak vegetation indices, phenological timings, and phenological durations, derived from satellite images.
Vegetation indices, the most widely used approach for assessing crop growth, were used to evaluate the peak development based on the maximum value during the growing season. We extracted the annual maximum value (VImax) of four vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, GCVI, and NDWI) during the May-October growing period as candidate yield proxies. Given that rice paddies in the study area are relatively narrow and interspersed with irrigation canals, we used vegetation indices from both MODIS (500m resolution) and Landsat 8 (30m resolution) imagery to account for this effect. 
Phenological timing metrics represented the dates when vegetation reaches key developmental stages, extracted from the EVI2 seasonal trajectory. MODIS and HLS LSP products identify seven timing stages based on amplitude thresholds that indicate the percentage of seasonal amplitude reached (15%, 50%, 90%). The seven phenological timings are Greenup (U15), MidGreenup (U50), and Maturity (U90) during greenup, Peak greenness (Peak), and Senescence (D90), MidGreenDown (D50), and Dormancy (D15) during senescence. Each timing metric was converted to a Day Of Year (DOY). 
Phenological duration metrics were calculated as the temporal interval between all possible pairs of the seven timing metrics, yielding 21 duration metrics. These durations quantify the length of specific growth periods and enable assessment of which developmental phases most strongly influence yield formation. 
The comparative analysis was conducted at three hierarchical levels using field data from the Saedlman-managed plots, where yield measurements were available. Level 1 analyzed all available field-year observations (n = 68), representing the actual cultivation records across diverse cultivars and years. This dataset includes 45 different cultivars grown over seven years (Supplementary S. X), with cultivar allocation varying annually according to operational management decisions rather than experimental design. This reflects realistic agricultural conditions where cultivar selection responds to environmental factors, market demands, and management strategies. Level 2 focused on the three most frequently cultivated cultivars (GQ, DJ, SK; n=7 years each, combined n=21) to reduce variability from cultivar diversity while maintaining multi-year replication. Level 3 examined each cultivar separately (n=7 years each) to identify cultivar-specific patterns and assess the influence of spatial heterogeneity on prediction performance. 
For each field-year observation, satellite metrics were extracted by averaging pixel values within the corresponding field boundary. For Landsat 8 (30m resolution), multiple pixels typically fell within each field, and their values were spatially averaged. For MODIS (500m resolution), pixel footprints often exceeded individual field boundaries, potentially capturing contaminated values including adjacent fields and irrigation infrastructure. Pearson correlation coefficients between satellite-derived values and field-measured yields were calculated for each metric. Statistical significance was assessed at α=0.05 for peak vegetation indices and phenological timings. For phenological durations, however, given the large number of comparisons (21 metrics), a Bonferroni correction was applied to control the family-wise error rate (adjusted α = 0.05/21 = 0.0024).

### 3.2. Environmental Driver Analysis
To understand how environmental factors at specific times regulate crop growth and influence yield determination, we analyzed the effects of environmental variables on phenological timing. Since phenological durations are determined by the interval between start and end stages, our analysis focused on how environmental factors correlate with these key phenological timings. We performed this analysis using 20 environmental variables, comprising five factors (precipitation, salinity, air temperature, accumulated temperature, and vapor pressure deficit) across four critical growth months (May to August). Each combination of factor and month was treated as an independent variable in the correlation analysis. Phenological timing metrics were extracted for all rice paddy pixels across the Seosan A district and spatially averaged to obtain annual mean timing values for each year. This district-wide averaging approach was considered to match the spatial representativeness of point-based environmental monitoring data. This analytical framework was applied to two temporal scales, using a recent 8-year period with HLS data and a long-term 23-year period with MCD12Q2 data. To validate the use of MCD12Q2 to extend the temporal analysis, the consistency between the two datasets was first confirmed by validating overlapping years. We adopted two distinct statistical approaches to assess environmental drivers. The influence of each environmental variable on the start stages was assessed using Pearson correlations, while the influence on the end stages was assessed using partial correlations. The partial correlation controlled for the timing of the start stage to isolate environmental effects on the senescence phase independent of earlier developmental timing.

### 3.3. Spatial Vulnerability Assessment
To map spatial patterns of chronic vulnerability across the Seosan A district, we extended the phenology-based analysis from field-scale to regional-scale assessment. This spatial analysis used phenological metrics extracted from all rice paddy pixels across the whole district, enabling comprehensive vulnerability mapping beyond the field-validated area managed by Saedlman.
We employed two complementary approaches to characterize spatial vulnerability patterns, applying both methods to HLS (8 years, 2016-2023) and MCD12Q2 (23 years, 2001-2023) datasets. The HLS analysis provides higher spatial resolution (30m) for detailed spatial compartmentalization, while the MCD12Q2 analysis provides long-term temporal context.
First, frequency analysis identified regions experiencing recurrent stress. Vulnerable conditions were defined as the phenology-based optimal metric determined in Section 3.1 falling below the 10th percentile threshold counted from all spatiotemporal observations of rice paddy pixels across the district. This conservative global threshold identifies conditions sufficiently extreme to indicate substantial stress regardless of cultivar turnover. For each pixel, we counted the frequency of vulnerable conditions across the respective study period to distinguish chronic vulnerability from isolated poor-performance years. For the MCD12Q2 dataset, frequency is classified by the number of vulnerable years, with ≥10 occurrences (out of 23 years) being regarded as severe chronic vulnerability. For the shorter HLS period, frequency classes were proportionally scaled by dividing the 8-year period into quartiles.
Second, K-means clustering was applied to establish discrete vulnerability classes based on the distribution of yield proxy values across all years. We specified six clusters (k=6) to provide vulnerability categories ranging from stable to severely vulnerable conditions, offering six levels of granularity while maintaining spatial pattern interpretability.
Finally, we examined the spatial patterns of vulnerability in relation to the environmental drivers identified in Section 3.2. To assess the spatial manifestation of environmental controls, we performed additional K-means clustering (k=6) analyses on key phenological timing stages and compared these timing-based clusters with the vulnerability clusters established above. This multi-metric spatial comparison enables investigation of which phenological phases most strongly correspond to observed spatial vulnerability patterns.

## 4. Results
### 4.1. Identification and Performance Analysis of the Optimal Yield Proxy
To identify the most effective satellite-based proxy for rice yield, we compared three categories of metrics, including vegetation indices (VIs), phenological timings, and phenological durations. The analysis was conducted at three levels. First, we analyzed all available cultivar-year combinations (n=68) to establish a general relationship. Second, we focused on the three most frequently cultivated cultivars throughout the study period (GQ, DJ, and SK; n=7 years each, combined n=21) to reduce variability from inconsistent cultivation. Third, we examined each cultivar separately (n=7 years each) to identify cultivar-specific patterns.
As a baseline assessment, we evaluated correlations between annual peak values of four vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NDWI, and GCVI) from two satellite sources (Terra MODIS and Landsat 8) and rice yield ([[S2.Complete Correlation Between VIs and Yield|Supplementary Table S1]]). Overall, peak vegetation indices showed limited predictive performance. The most widely used index, NDVI, exhibited near-zero correlation with yield, suggesting that maximum canopy greenness does not correspond to yield-determining growth stages ([[RSE_Core Result_T1|Table 1]]). Among all indices tested, Landsat NDWI showed the highest correlation, though this remained weak for operational yield prediction, explaining approximately 6% of yield variance with r² = 0.06. To assess the effect of spatial resolution, we compared Landsat-derived NDWI (30m) with MODIS-derived NDWI (500m). When the same NDWI was derived from coarse-resolution MODIS data, the correlation deteriorated substantially (r = -0.09), likely due to the inability to capture field-scale heterogeneity that finer Landsat resolution preserves. These findings collectively indicate that snapshot-based vegetation indices are insufficient for reliable yield estimation, motivating the need for phenology-based approaches that integrate seasonal growth dynamics.
We next evaluated phenological timings, which represent the dates when vegetation reaches key developmental stages. Phenological timings demonstrated substantially improved performance compared to peak vegetation indices ([[S3.Complete Correlation Between LSP and Yield|Supplementary Table S2]]). Analysis of the full dataset revealed that early-season timings (U15 through U90) mainly showed negative correlations with yield, while late-season timing (D50 and D15) exhibited a positive correlation. This pattern indicates that earlier onset of green-up and delayed senescence both contribute to higher yields. The strength of these relationships varied by analysis level, revealing cultivar-specific patterns. For the general relationship across all cultivars, U90 showed the strongest correlation ([[RSE_Core Result_T1|Table 1]]). However, when cultivar variability was reduced by focusing on the three repeatedly cultivated cultivars, U50 exhibited notably stronger performance ([[RSE_Core Result_T1|Table 1]]). This shift in optimal timing suggests that inherent cultivar-specific characteristics, such as yield potential, maturity period, or stress tolerance, may obscure the relationship between phenological timing and yield when not accounted for. Despite this substantial improvement, individual phenological timings still explained less than half of yield variance, showing that the timing of specific stages alone does not fully capture the processes determining final yield.
Building on the observation that both early green-up and delayed senescence contribute to higher yields, we evaluated phenological durations, defined as the intervals between key growth stages. A comprehensive evaluation of 21 duration metrics revealed that phenological durations exhibited the strongest correlations with yield among all metrics tested (Supplementary Table S3). Among these, U90-D50, representing the interval from 90% green-up to 50% senescence, emerged as the optimal proxy. This duration showed strong positive correlations, with r = 0.523*** across all cultivars and r = 0.781*** for the three repeatedly cultivated cultivars (Table 1, Fig. 2a). These correlations remained highly significant even after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (α = 0.0024). At the individual cultivar level, even stronger linear relationships were observed for GQ (r = 0.874*) and DJ (r = 0.851*) (Table 1, Fig. 2b-c), demonstrating that when genetic variability is controlled, the U90-D50 duration becomes a highly accurate predictor of yield. Agronomically, U90-D50 corresponds to the reproductive phase, encompassing panicle development, flowering, and grain filling. Given its superior statistical performance and clear agronomic interpretability, U90-D50 was selected as the optimal satellite-based proxy for rice yield estimation.
However, the predictive performance of U90-D50 at the individual cultivar level was not uniform. Despite analyzing individual cultivars to account for cultivar-specific characteristics, SK showed an exceptionally weaker, non-significant relationship (r = 0.525, Fig. 2d), in contrast to the strong correlations observed for GQ and DJ. This performance discrepancy can be attributed to differences in the spatial heterogeneity of duration values within each cultivar's cultivation area, as illustrated in Figure 3. Analysis of pixel-level duration distributions revealed that SK exhibited the highest spatial variability across years (mean σ = 6.5 days), while DJ showed the lowest (mean σ = 3.7 days), with GQ showing intermediate variability (mean σ = 4.4 days) despite its substantially larger cultivation area (Supplementary Table S4). This pattern highlights how spatial heterogeneity exposes limitations in the yield sampling methodology. Given that the yield data were derived from five randomly sampled hills per cultivar plot, high within-cultivar variability compromises measurement representativeness. For GQ and DJ, relatively uniform growth allowed limited sampling to capture spatial averages adequately. In contrast, SK's high variability indicates substantial growth differences that likely prevented the five hills from representing the cultivation area accurately. The weaker SK correlation, therefore, reflects a sampling limitation under heterogeneous conditions rather than a weakness in the U90-D50 metric itself. These findings underscore the importance of adequate spatial sampling and consideration of cultivar-specific spatial heterogeneity when applying satellite-based phenological metrics for operational yield estimation.

### 4.2. Environmental Drivers of Phenological Duration
While the HLS dataset was ideal for identifying the optimal proxy in Section 4.1, a longer time series is required to reliably diagnose the influence of long-term environmental drivers and climatic variability. We therefore utilized the 23-year (2001–2023) MCD12Q2 dataset for the primary driver analysis. To validate this substitution, we first compared the annual mean U90-D50 duration derived from MCD12Q2 (500 m) with that from HLS (30 m) for the overlapping 8-year period (2016–2023), as described in Section 3.X. The comparison of rice paddy pixel averages showed moderate agreement between the two datasets (r = 0.67; Supplementary Figure SX). This level of consistency, considering the significant difference in spatial resolution, confirmed that MCD12Q2 captures the same essential inter-annual variability and justified its use for the subsequent long-term temporal analysis.
Analysis of the 23-year MODIS time series identified salinity as the dominant driver of U90 (growth onset) timing (Figure 4). Among all 20 environmental variables tested, salinity during May-July showed the strongest and most consistent positive correlations with U90 (r=0.55-0.62, p<0.01, n=23), indicating that higher early-season salinity significantly delays rice growth onset. This salinity-phenology relationship was further confirmed by the 8-year HLS dataset, which exhibited similarly strong correlations (r=0.75-0.82, p<0.05, n=8). Notably, August salinity showed no significant correlation with U90, indicating temporal specificity to the early vegetative phase. In contrast, other environmental factors, including precipitation, temperature, accumulated temperature, and vapor pressure deficit, showed weak or non-significant relationships with U90 timing. These results identify early-season salinity as the primary diagnosable environmental driver that delays rice growth onset.
In contrast to the clear salinity dominance for U90 ([[RSE_Core Result_Fig.4|Figure 4]]), analysis of D50 (senescence timing) revealed substantially greater complexity ([[RSE_Core Result_Fig.5|Figure 5]]). After controlling for U90 influence through partial correlation analysis, no single dominant environmental driver emerged. The long-term MODIS dataset revealed that July salinity significantly accelerated senescence (r = -0.50, p = 0.016, n = 23), indicating that elevated mid-season salinity stress induces premature leaf senescence. However, the 8-year HLS period showed no significant relationship with July salinity (r = 0.67, p = 0.145, n = 8), suggesting that other environmental factors or management practices may have compensated for salinity stress during this period, preventing accelerated senescence. Unlike controlled laboratory conditions, field-level senescence timing can be modulated by adaptive management practices such as adjusted irrigation timing or nutrient application. Other environmental factors, including precipitation, temperature, accumulated temperature, and vapor pressure deficit, similarly exhibited weak and non-significant relationships with D50 timing. These inconsistent patterns likely reflect threshold-dependent responses, where environmental variables influence senescence only when they exceed critical levels, and complex interactions among multiple factors rather than a single dominant driver. Consequently, the primary driver of U90-D50 duration variability is early-season salinity, which governs growth onset (U90), rather than factors controlling senescence timing (D50).

### 4.3. Spatial compartmentalization of rice fields
Temporal analysis alone cannot reveal where environmental constraints persistently limit production. Satellite remote sensing's spatial coverage enables comprehensive vulnerability mapping across heterogeneous landscapes, essential for focusing management resources to high-risk areas. We analyze the spatial distribution of phenological duration to identify regions of chronic vulnerability, establish severity levels, and attribute observed patterns to specific environmental drivers identified in the temporal analysis. This approach transforms correlation-based yield prediction into spatially explicit diagnosis of production constraints.
We conducted frequency analysis of U90-D50 duration across the study area to map chronic vulnerability patterns. Vulnerable conditions were defined as durations falling below the 10th percentile (HLS: 57 days; MCD: 61 days) of all spatiotemporal observations from rice paddy pixels. This threshold captures conditions substantially below the typical range while maintaining sufficient spatial coverage for pattern detection. For each pixel, we calculated the frequency of vulnerable conditions across the study period to distinguish chronic vulnerability from isolated poor-performance years. The 23-year MCD12Q2 analysis revealed distinct spatial patterns when vulnerability frequencies were categorized into four classes (≤3, 4-6, 7-9, ≥10 occurrences). High-frequency vulnerability was concentrated in southeastern regions (Gung-ri, Gisan-ri, Sagi-ri), the southwestern tip (Ganwoldo-ri), and portions of the western-central area (Figure 6b). The 8-year HLS analysis, categorized into proportionally equivalent frequency classes (≤2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8 occurrences), showed remarkably similar spatial patterns despite the substantially finer spatial resolution (Figure 6a). The southeastern and southwestern vulnerable zones identified in the long-term record were clearly reproduced in the recent high-resolution analysis. This spatial correspondence across datasets with different temporal extents (8 vs. 23 years) and spatial resolutions (30m vs. 500m) confirms that the identified regions experience chronic environmental constraints rather than temporary stress events.
While frequency analysis identifies where vulnerability occurs, clustering provides a complementary approach to establish discrete severity levels across the landscape. We applied K-means clustering (k = 6) to the pixel-wise distribution of U90-D50 duration values across all years, with clusters ranked by centroid values to represent a severity gradient from shortest to longest durations. Shorter duration centroids correspond to greater vulnerability, as they indicate persistently abbreviated reproductive-phase development. The clustering analysis revealed distinct spatial compartmentalization, with the most severe zones (Clusters 1-2) concentrated in southern regions, moderate zones (Clusters 3-4) occupying transitional areas, and mild or non-vulnerable zones (Clusters 5-6) dominating northern portions of the study area (Fig. 7). This spatial pattern closely mirrors the frequency-based vulnerability distribution (Fig. 6), confirming that southern regions experience not only more frequent vulnerability events but also more severe chronic constraints on reproductive-phase duration. The clustering approach provides an operational framework for prioritizing management interventions, as the discrete severity classes enable straightforward field-level risk assessment and resource allocation.
Having identified spatial vulnerability patterns, we attribute them to specific environmental drivers by comparing duration-based zones with growth onset timing. We performed K-means clustering (k=6) on U90 timing across the study area, with clusters ranked by centroid values where higher values indicate delayed green-up. Given that early-season salinity dominantly controls growth onset timing, spatial overlap between delayed-U90 zones and duration-vulnerable zones indicates salinity-driven constraints. Substantial overlap emerged in southern regions, where areas classified as severely vulnerable in duration analysis (Fig. 7, Clusters 1-2) predominantly coincided with regions exhibiting the most delayed growth onset (Fig. 8a, Clusters 5-6). Conversely, some duration-vulnerable areas showed normal U90 timing, indicating that constraints other than early-season salinity affect these regions. Comparison with irrigation infrastructure revealed that the overlapping vulnerable zones align closely with pumping station coverage patterns (Fig. 8b). While station-specific salinity data were unavailable, monitoring within Ganwol Lake showed that salinity levels increase toward the southern portions closer to the coast. This spatial gradient in source water salinity corresponds to the observed vulnerability patterns, indicating that irrigation water quality constitutes a critical management target for reducing chronic vulnerability in affected areas.
