# Food security and climate change
## Paragraph outline
- ##### 독자의 반응 목표
	- 쌀은 정말 중요한 식량 작물이구나.
	- 기후변화가 쌀 생산량을 위협하는구나.
	- 이건 전 지구적 식량 안보와 직결되는 중요하고 시급한 문제구나.
- ##### 전략
	- 가장 큰 그림인 'Global food security'와, 'Rice'의 중요성을 언급하며 관심 유도
	- 벼의 재배 특성으로부터 재배 지역이 저지대 임을 유도
	- 기후변화로 저지대가 받을 수 있는 영향을 언급하며 위협 구체화

## Manuscript

Global food security is facing a critical challenge as climate change threatens the production of rice, the staple food for more than half of the world's population (Khush, 2005; Naylor et al., 2007; Seck et al., 2012). Rice has the unique characteristic of being highly sensitive to water deficits (Davatgar et al., 2009; Tuong and Bouman, 2003) while also being adapted to flooded conditions through the development of aerenchyma (Steffens et al., 2011; Voesenek and Bailey-Serres, 2015). This trait explains why its cultivation is concentrated in lowland areas where a stable water supply can be maintained (Bouman and Tuong, 2001). In fact, irrigated and rainfed lowlands account for approximately 75% and 19% of global rice production, respectively (Bouman et al., 2007), indicating that the water supply system is the dominant determinant of where rice is grown. However, these vital agricultural zones are increasingly vulnerable. Climate change not only complicates the stable supply of water resources through changing precipitation patterns (Konapala et al., 2020; Schewe et al., 2014) but also induces direct threats such as the loss of arable land (Zhang and Cai, 2011) and salt stress from sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion (Mimura, 1999; Dasgupta et al., 2018; Elsey-Quirk et al., 2024).
