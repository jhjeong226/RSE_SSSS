The study was conducted in the Seosan A district (36.60–36.79° N, 126.37–126.52° E) (Figure 1), a large-scale reclaimed agricultural area on the west coast of Korea. This site provides an ideal setting for examining environmental controls on rice phenology and yield for three key reasons. First, as reclaimed tidal flats where persistent salinity stress remains a primary constraint despite decades of cultivation, the area represents coastal agricultural systems vulnerable to environmental variability. Second, the district's spatial extent enables satellite-based phenology analysis at operational scales while maintaining relatively uniform climatic conditions. Third, a commercial rice farming cooperative (Saedlman) managing 610 hectares within the district provided comprehensive multi-year yield records that allow validation of remotely sensed phenological metrics. 

The Seosan A district was reclaimed from tidal flats in 1984, with agricultural use beginning in 1995. Despite nearly three decades of cultivation, soil salinity remains the dominant environmental challenge due to the site's geological origin. The study area experiences a temperate marine climate with an annual average temperature of 12.1°C, ranging from −1.6°C in January to 25.3°C in August. Annual precipitation averages 1,253.7 mm, with approximately 56% concentrated during summer months (June–August). This climate pattern supports a single annual rice cropping system, with transplanting in late May and harvesting from early to mid-October. 

Yield data were obtained from Saedlman Agricultural Corporation, which cultivates 610 hectares within the Seosan A district under an integrated management system. From 2016 to 2023, the cooperative grew 45 different rice cultivars with diverse agronomic characteristics. The 2017 growing season was excluded from analysis due to incomplete yield documentation. Among the 45 cultivars, only three were cultivated continuously across all seven analyzed years (2016, 2018–2023), providing sufficient temporal replication for robust phenology-yield analysis. These cultivars include Golden Queen, a semi-waxy medium-late japonica variety with low amylose content; Dongjinchal, a waxy (glutinous) medium-late japonica cultivar; and Samkwang, a non-glutinous medium-maturing japonica variety. Field allocation for these cultivars varied annually, which helped minimize site-specific confounding effects by ensuring that observed phenology-yield relationships reflected cultivar traits and environmental responses rather than fixed field characteristics. 

While yield data collection was limited to the 610-hectare Saedlman management area, phenological analysis was conducted across the entire Seosan A district to capture broader spatial patterns of crop development and environmental stress. This approach enabled identification of spatial vulnerability patterns beyond the immediate yield sampling locations, providing context for understanding how environmental drivers affect rice growth across the coastal agricultural landscape.

The study was conducted in rice paddies within the Seosan A District (36.60° ~ 36.79° N, 126.37° ~ 126.52° E), a large-scale reclaimed agricultural area on the west coast of the Republic of Korea. This reclaimed land was completed in 1984, and agricultural use began in 1995. Geologically, the area was formed by reclaiming tidal flats, making soil salinity a persistent primary environmental constraint for rice cultivation. Despite nearly three decades of agricultural use, disputes surrounding potential salinity damage and its impact on yields remain ongoing.

The study site exhibits a temperate marine climate, with an annual average temperature of 12.1°C. The warmest month is August (average 25.3°C), and the coldest month is January (average -1.6°C). Annual precipitation averages 1,253.7 mm, with approximately 56% concentrated in the summer months (June-August). This climatic pattern dictates the region's rice farming system, which is characterized by monoculture, with transplanting in late May and harvesting from early to mid-October.

Data for this study were collected from 'Saedlman,' an agricultural cooperative corporation that cultivates 610 hectares of rice paddies within the Seosan A District. Saedlman operates an integrated production system, collectively managing the entire rice harvesting process. The cooperative's cultivar allocation exhibited significant variability over the study period. From 2016 to 2023 (excluding 2017 due to data unavailability), a total of 45 different cultivars were harvested. Regarding their characteristics, while maturity was predominantly medium and late, other traits such as morphology, resistance, palatability, and purpose were highly diverse. More importantly, the field allocation for these cultivars varied from year to year, making it nearly impossible to directly match field locations and cultivars across years. Given this high year-to-year variability, three cultivars (Golden Queen, Dongjinchal, Samkwang) that were most frequently cultivated were selected for analysis to control for phenological differences arising from cultivar characteristics.

A significant characteristic of the study area is its unique irrigation system. The 610 ha of fields managed by Saedlman share identical climatic conditions and a common geological background as reclaimed land. However, irrigation water is supplied via five major pumping stations that all draw from Ganwol Lake, a freshwater reservoir formed when the reclamation seawall separated this area from Cheonsu Bay. Despite the common water source, the stations' different locations result in varying salinity levels. This unique setting provides a valuable natural experiment, allowing for precise isolation of salinity effects on rice phenology and yield while controlling for climate, soil type, and management practices (Figure 1).
