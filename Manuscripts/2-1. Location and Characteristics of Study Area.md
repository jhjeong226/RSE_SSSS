The study was conducted in rice paddies within the Seosan A district (36.60° ~ 36.79° N, 126.37° ~ 126.52° E), a large-scale reclaimed agricultural area on the west coast of the Republic of Korea. This reclaimed land was completed in 1984, and agricultural use began in 1995. Geologically, the area was formed by reclaiming tidal flats, making soil salinity a persistent primary environmental constraint for rice cultivation. Despite nearly three decades of agricultural use, disputes surrounding potential salinity damage and its impact on yields remain ongoing.

The study site exhibits a temperate marine climate, with an annual average temperature of 12.1°C. The warmest month is August (average 25.3°C), and the coldest month is January (average -1.6°C). Annual precipitation averages 1,253.7 mm, with approximately 56% concentrated in the summer months (June-August). This climatic pattern dictates the region's rice farming system, which is characterized by mono-cultivation, with transplanting in late May and harvesting from early to mid-October.

Data for this study were collected from 'Saedlman,' an agricultural cooperative corporation that cultivates 610 hectares of rice paddies within the Seosan A district. Saedlman operates an integrated production system, collectively managing the entire rice harvesting process. Furthermore, the cooperative’s cultivation system had significant variability patterns over the last seven years. In 2017, record-breaking salinity damage occurred. Due to this damage, farmers re-transplanted rice in July which was a one-month delay. Because of this impact, rice production records from that year are incomplete and thus unusable for this research. Therefore, this study uses reliable data from 2016 to 2023, excluding 2017. During this period, a total of 45 different cultivars were harvested. Regarding their characteristics, while maturity was predominantly medium and late, other traits like morphology, resistance, palatability, and productivity were highly diverse. More importantly, the field allocation for these cultivars varied from year to year. This irregularity makes it nearly impossible to directly match field locations and cultivars across the years. Under this high turnover, three cultivars (Golden Queen, Dongjinchal, Samkwang) were most frequently cultivated. These three share a medium-late maturity trait. Golden Queen is semi-glutinous high-quality rice. Dongjinchal is glutinous rice for food product processing. Samkwang is non-glutinous high quality rice. As each of the 45 cultivars has its own phenological and physiological traits, this results in different growth patterns and yield potentials, creating variability in the data. To minimize variability from diverse cultivar characteristics, this selected these three most frequently harvested cultivars for a cultivar-focused analysis.

Significant characteristic of the study area is its unique irrigation system. The 610 ha of vast fields managed by Saedlman share identical climatic conditions and a common geological background as reclaimed land. However, irrigation water is supplied via five differently located major pumping stations although all stations draw from a common freshwater lake, Ganwol Lake.

This unique setting provides a valuable natural experiment for salinity and this research. It allows for precise isolation and analysis of the effects of varying water quality, particularly salinity from different pumping stations on rice growth stages and final yield.
