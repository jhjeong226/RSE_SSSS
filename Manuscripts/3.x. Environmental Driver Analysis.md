## Manuscript

To identify the environmental drivers governing U90-D50 duration variability, we systematically analyzed relationships between phenological timings and monthly environmental conditions during the critical growth period (May-August). We examined five environmental factors: precipitation, salinity, air temperature, accumulated temperature (cumulative from May onward), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Each factor was evaluated at monthly resolution, resulting in 20 independent variables (5 factors × 4 months). This analytical framework was applied to two temporal scales: recent patterns using HLS data (2016-2023) and long-term patterns using MCD12Q2 data (2001-2023). To validate the use of MCD12Q2 for extending the analysis period, we first compared annual mean U90-D50 duration between the two datasets for the overlapping period (2016-2023, n=8). Duration values were calculated as spatial averages across all rice paddy pixels within the study area for both datasets. For subsequent driver analysis requiring yield data, the HLS dataset was limited to seven years (2016-2023, excluding 2017 due to missing yield records), while the full MCD12Q2 record (2001-2023, n=23) was used for long-term assessment. For the driver analysis, we applied two statistical approaches. For U90 (growth onset), we used Pearson correlation to directly assess environmental influences. For D50 (senescence timing), we employed partial correlation controlling for U90 influence, as earlier onset naturally allows potentially longer vegetative development, which could confound the D50-environment relationship.
