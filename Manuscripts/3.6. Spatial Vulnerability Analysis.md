To identify and compartmentalize regions of chronic vulnerability, we conducted spatial analysis using U90-D50 duration at three levels. First, we defined vulnerable conditions as durations below the 10th percentile of all spatiotemporal observations. Given the annual variability in cultivar allocation across fields, we used a global threshold rather than pixel-specific baselines. This threshold was calculated separately for HLS (2016-2023) and MCD12Q2 (2001-2023) datasets to assess temporal consistency of vulnerability patterns. Second, for each pixel, we calculated the frequency of vulnerable conditions across the study period. This frequency-based approach distinguishes chronic vulnerability from isolated poor-performance years. The analysis was conducted at both temporal scales (8-year HLS and 23-year MCD12Q2) to evaluate whether vulnerable regions remain consistent across different time periods. Third, we applied K-means clustering (k=6) to mean U90-D50 duration values to compartmentalize regions by severity level. Clusters were ranked by centroid values, with shorter durations indicating higher vulnerability. Finally, to link spatial patterns to the environmental drivers identified in Section 4.2, we performed additional K-means clustering (k=6) on U90 timing. This U90-based clustering was compared with irrigation infrastructure maps to evaluate whether spatial vulnerability patterns correspond to salinity stress zones governed by irrigation water sources.
