## Manuscript

To identify regions of chronic vulnerability, we conducted frequency analysis of U90-D50 duration across the study area. Vulnerable conditions were defined as durations falling below the 10th percentile of all spatiotemporal observations. This threshold identifies conditions substantially below the typical range while maintaining sufficient spatial coverage for pattern detection. For each pixel, we calculated the frequency of vulnerable conditions across the study period to distinguish chronic vulnerability from isolated poor-performance years. Analysis of the 8-year HLS record revealed distinct spatial patterns, with southern regions averaging 3.2 vulnerable years (out of 8 total), compared to 1.4 years in northern regions, representing a 2.3-fold difference in vulnerability frequency (Figure 6a). The 23-year MCD12Q2 analysis showed highly consistent spatial patterns (spatial correlation r=0.78, p<0.001), with southern regions averaging 8.1 vulnerable years versus 3.9 years in the north (Figure 6b). Despite differences in temporal extent (8 vs. 23 years) and spatial resolution (30m vs. 500m), the strong spatial correspondence between datasets confirms that southern regions experience chronic environmental constraints rather than temporary stress events specific to particular observation periods.
